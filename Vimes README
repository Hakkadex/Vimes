root user permission is needed to install this tool, sudo su or be root before using the install script in bash.
Use bash shell, currently not working in zsh (I haven't checked fish might want to test that)
Paste the Vimes installation script into your bash shell terminal (must be bash!)
You can run the tool from any shell after, but the installation must be done inside bash shell ok!
use command "vimesget" to use the tool
Example usage "vimesget New York" "vimesget London" "vimesget USA" "vimesget Tokyo"

This script will make a directory called "Vimes" on your desktop with the files inside
It will then create a symlink for vimesget and give the tool and vimes.py execution permissions (this is a python based tool)

Vimes the fearless night watch officer will track down those criminals with his trusted watchmen Nobby and Colon
This tool will search for recent crimes that happened in the past 6 months and sort them in chronological order from distant to recent in your terminal. It will prioritize violent crimes, robberies, murders, shootings, stabbings etc.
Enjoy the assistance of Captain Vimes the trusted Watchman in your terminal.

The tool also has the capability to search for names and specifics, input known criminal names, high profile targets etc instead of a location to pull reports of those incidents.
This tool is for quick scanning curiosity, not intended for professional database scraping, this is a hobbyist tool for terminal junkies.
